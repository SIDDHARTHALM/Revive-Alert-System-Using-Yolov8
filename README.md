# Revive-Alert-System-Using-Yolov8
A Revive Alert System using the YOLOv8 algorithm is designed to enhance road safety by monitoring drivers for signs of fatigue. This system utilizes a camera to capture real-time video of the driver, which is then processed using the YOLOv8 object detection algorithm to detect indicators of drowsiness.
